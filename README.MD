# pwf2tools
This is a modded version of RMGRich's/posesix's ptr2tools. It's made to be built for Debian based distros. It's going to soon be implemented in the C++ GUI for Linux once complete.

# How to build?
Clone the git and run cd pwf2tools && sh make.sh
It will ask for sudo to install nessecary building requirements if not already installed.
A new folder in the git cloned repo will be called "bin" which will have what you need. pwf2int, pwf2tex, and pwf2spm.

## Rich's README
This is kind of useless to put since its based on MinGW, which is based off of Arch Linux's building (pacman compared to sudo, etc), so I have taken it out.
